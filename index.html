            <p id="first">
                I have always thought accounting was my calling. I studied accounting for four years, across two colleges and worked numerous accounting related jobs. However, taking econometric and economic forecasting courses made me realize where my passion lies - Data and coding. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                My first year at UCLA did not go as planned. I received low grades in my economics and accounting classes, and started doubting my academic capabilities. That is, until I started taking programming and econometric classes and excelling in them. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                Through this, I realized poor grades do not necessarily translate to failure. Instead, grades are one of the many performance indicators that may reflect where my talent and passion truly rest. Therefore, I decided to shift my career focus to the field of data which I am motivated to learn more about every single day, even if I have to work twice as hard to catch up to others who started on this path earlier.
